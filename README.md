# Project: Data Analysis and Key Variable Relevance

## Overview

This project involves various data analysis tasks aimed at identifying the relevance of key variables. Each task has a specific objective such as data cleaning, regression analysis, and more. The end goal is to derive insights on the significance of different variables in our dataset.

## Objectives

	1.	Data Cleaning:
	•	Clean the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data entries.
	2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
	•	Perform EDA to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns within the data.
	3.	Regression Analysis:
	•	Apply regression models to identify key predictors and their impact on the target variable.
	4.	Classification Analysis:
	•	Implement classification algorithms to categorize data points and evaluate their performance.
	5.	Clustering:
	•	Use clustering techniques to group similar data points and analyze the clusters.
	6.	Feature Engineering:
	•	Create new features from the existing data to improve model performance.
	7.	Model Evaluation:
	•	Evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to find the relevance of key variables in the dataset. By understanding which variables significantly impact our target outcome, we can make more informed decisions and predictions.
